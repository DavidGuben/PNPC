        Welcome to Paws N’ Pose Cuttery, my name is Shari. I am the founder of Paws N’ Pose Cuttery, accredited dog groomer and loving dog owner. I feel that a home is never complete without a loyal and forever caring canine companion. They protect our homes, love us unconditionally and always treat us like family. Our dogs should be treated with kindness and respect for all they do for us. With that in mind I took up dog grooming to keep our loyal friends happy, healthy and clean.
